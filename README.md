# IDENTIFY-APPARELS-WITH-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
Identify and categorise the apparels into the correct categories (Shoe, Top, Trouser etc.) using just the image of the apparel.


Apparels and Accesories are one of the major contributors in e-commerce now-a-days. 
A major challenge E-commerce face is categorizing these apparels from just the images especially when the categories provided by the brands are inconsistent. 

This creates an interesting computer vision probelm and a HOT topic in machinelearning and deep learning researches..


In this model, a dataset with 70k images will be used that will be broadly categorised into following 10 categories.
Label	Description
0	    T-shirt/top
1	    Trouser
2	    Pullover
3	    Dress
4	    Coat
5	    Sandal
6	    Shirt
7	    Sneaker
8	    Bag
9	    Ankle boot


The data was divided as follows:
TRAINING DATA : 48K IMAGES
CROSS VALIDATION DATA: 12K IMAGES
TESTING DATA: 10K IMAGES

#THE MODEL PREDICTED THE TESTING DATA WITH 93%.
NOTE: Accuracy can be increased by regularisaton techniques.
